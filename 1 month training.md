# **Personalized 1-Month Software Engineering Study Plan**

This guide is tailored to leverage your existing back-end skills in .NET and PHP while building expertise in modern front-end technologies, DevOps, and core computer science concepts to help you excel as a well-rounded Software Engineer.

### **Core Objectives for the Month:**

1. **Master a Modern Front-End Framework:** Gain proficiency in React to complement your back-end skills.  
2. **Deepen System Design Knowledge:** Understand how to build scalable and maintainable applications from the ground up.  
3. **Embrace DevOps Practices:** Learn to containerize and deploy your applications.  
4. **Strengthen CS Fundamentals:** Refresh your knowledge of data structures and algorithms, which are crucial for technical interviews.

## **The Project: Kanban-Style Project Management Tool**

Building a project from scratch is the best way to learn. You will create a full-stack web application similar to Trello or Jira.

* **Features:**  
  * User registration and login (Authentication).  
  * Create, view, update, and delete projects.  
  * Within each project, create tasks organized in columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").  
  * Drag-and-drop tasks between columns.  
  * Assign tasks to users (optional, advanced).  
* **Proposed Tech Stack:**  
  * **Back-End:** **.NET 6/7/8 API (C\#)** \- This builds directly on your strongest skill.  
  * **Front-End:** **React** \- The most in-demand front-end library.  
  * **Database:** **PostgreSQL** or **MS SQL Server** \- Both are excellent choices.  
  * **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens).  
  * **Deployment:** **Docker**.

## **Month-Long To-Do List & Study Plan**

### **Week 1: Foundations & Back-End API Setup (Focus: 70% Backend, 30% Theory)**

* **Daily (30-60 mins):**  
  * Practice one easy/medium problem on LeetCode or HackerRank focusing on Arrays and Strings.  
* **To-Do List:**  
  * **\[ \] .NET API Scaffolding:**  
    * Set up a new .NET Web API project.  
    * Use Entity Framework Core to define your database models (User, Project, Task, Column).  
    * Set up your database connection using PostgreSQL or SQL Server.  
  * **\[ \] API Endpoints (CRUD):**  
    * Implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for Projects.  
    * Implement full CRUD API endpoints for Tasks.  
    * Use a tool like Postman to test every endpoint thoroughly.  
  * **\[ \] Authentication:**  
    * Implement user registration and login endpoints.  
    * Generate a JWT upon successful login and require it for accessing other endpoints.  
  * **\[ \] Study:**  
    * Watch a tutorial series on **React Fundamentals** (components, props, state).  
    * Review **REST API design principles**.

### **Week 2: Front-End Deep Dive with React (Focus: 80% Frontend, 20% Theory)**

* **Daily (30-60 mins):**  
  * Practice one LeetCode/HackerRank problem focusing on Linked Lists and Stacks/Queues.  
* **To-Do List:**  
  * **\[ \] React Project Setup:**  
    * Create a new React application using Vite or Create React App.  
    * Structure your project with folders for components, pages, services, etc.  
  * **\[ \] Component Creation:**  
    * Build static React components for the UI: Navbar, ProjectCard, TaskCard, Column.  
    * Use functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect).  
  * **\[ \] API Integration:**  
    * Use axios to fetch data from your .NET API.  
    * Create a page to display all projects fetched from your back-end.  
  * **\[ \] State Management:**  
    * Implement the logic to add and view projects and tasks, managing the state within your React components.  
  * **\[ \] Study:**  
    * Learn about React Hooks in-depth (useState, useEffect, useContext).

### **Week 3: Advanced Features & State Management (Focus: 60% Frontend, 40% Backend)**

* **Daily (30-60 mins):**  
  * Practice one LeetCode/HackerRank problem focusing on Trees and Hash Tables.  
* **To-Do List:**  
  * **\[ \] Front-End Routing:**  
    * Integrate react-router-dom to create separate pages for login, registration, the project dashboard, and individual project views.  
  * **\[ \] Authentication Flow:**  
    * Connect your login and registration forms to the back-end API.  
    * Store the JWT in local storage and send it with every authenticated API request.  
    * Implement protected routes that are only accessible after login.  
  * **\[ \] Core Feature: Drag & Drop:**  
    * Implement a library like react-beautiful-dnd to allow users to drag tasks between columns.  
    * When a task is dropped, make an API call to your back-end to update its status/column.  
  * **\[ \] Study:**  
    * Explore a global state management library like **Redux Toolkit** or **Zustand**. Try to refactor one part of your app to use it.

### **Week 4: DevOps, Deployment & Polishing (Focus: 50% DevOps, 30% Polishing, 20% Theory)**

* **Daily (30-60 mins):**  
  * Review past LeetCode problems and attempt one medium/hard problem.  
* **To-Do List:**  
  * **\[ \] Containerization with Docker:**  
    * Create a Dockerfile for your .NET API.  
    * Create a Dockerfile for your React application.  
  * **\[ \] Orchestration:**  
    * Create a docker-compose.yml file to run your API, your React app, and your database together with a single command.  
  * **\[ \] Code Quality & UI/UX:**  
    * Refactor any messy code. Add comments where necessary.  
    * Improve the user interface. Use a simple CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI to make it look clean and professional.  
    * Ensure the application is responsive and works on mobile screens.  
  * **\[ \] Final Review:**  
    * Prepare to talk about your project's architecture, challenges, and the design choices you made.  
    * Do a mock interview with a friend or practice explaining your project out loud.

By the end of this month, you will not only have sharpened your existing skills but also have a complete, modern full-stack project in your portfolio that demonstrates your capabilities across the entire development lifecycle. Good luck\!
